Pac-Man Movement Exercise.

This is one of my first JavaScript projects that I have learned through the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stuck Development with MERN from MIT xPRO.

The purpose of this exercise was to create a Pac-Man animation using four different images (one Pac-Man with his face open and the other with his face closed to move from one side of the screen to the other and the other two for the return movement) that would move from an initial point on the screen, located at the upper left corner of the screen and move from left to right until reaching the other corner of the screen and return immediately after reaching the edge of the screen and do the same operation from right to left.
